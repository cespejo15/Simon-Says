# Simon-Says
### IEEE Workshop on Introduction to Microcontrollers

This was a 2-week workshop series done on 9/25/23 and 10/02/23

The presentation for the first week of this workshop is linked here: [Workshop 1](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tpx0dH-U_lhxfJUoJJe8hyobWCU6OQWlZdtda2sNHKU/edit#slide=id.g282488c5e96_0_51)

The presentation for the second week of this workshop is linked here: [Workshop 2](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rNxSnq_mr1zNdd4yuPJOM8jhLGElW5EtsAxfe7oRIMw/edit#slide=id.g285af8a9787_0_145)

### Week 1
Week 1 covered the basics of microcontrollers, some basic circuitry, and how to install the Arduino IDE. A hands-on example was then done using Arduino kits for our members.

### Week 2
Week 2 went into a more in-depth example of microcontrollers. We created a simon-says game using Arduino for our members to learn more about both coding in Arduino and also how to do basic circuitry.
